# üêã AHAB DAO Front-end (Local Development) 

This is the front-end repo that allows users to check the governance protocol. (Built with Buildspace x Thirdweb v1) 

 * deployed custom ERC-20 token
 * deployed ERC-1155 NFT that people can mint to join your DAO.
 * deployed governance contract + treasury.
 * built a dapp that lets people connect their wallet, get an NFT, see a DAO Dashboard where they can see other members + actually vote on proposals that      are executed directly by your governance contract.
